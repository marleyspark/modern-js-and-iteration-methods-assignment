/* Map 

In weeklyForecast array, the temperature properties are in Celcius
Please write an arrow function which takes weeklyForecast as an argument and returns a new array. The new array should include day objects like in
weeklyForecast array but the temperature value should be converted to Faherenheit.

the value of the first item in the new array should be 

{day: "Monday", temperature: 68, cloudCoverage: "broken", wind: 16}

The formula for converting Celcius to Faherenheit is: 
Divide by 5, then multiply by 9, then add 32

/* Filter

  We would like to know which days of the week are sunny. 
  Please write an arrow function which accepts weeklyForecast as an argument and returns an array of day obejcts. It should only contain days
  where cloud coverage is "clear" or "few". 

  when successful the return value should looks like this:

  [
    {day: "Thuesday", temperature: 22, cloudCoverage: "few", wind: 10},
    {day: "Wednesday", temperature: 26, cloudCoverage: "clear", wind: 5},
    {day: "Thursday", temperature: 24, cloudCoverage: "clear", wind: 5},
    {day: "Friday", temperature: 24, cloudCoverage: "few", wind: 18},

/*Spread operator*/

/* 
We have received new weather data that Sunday cloudCoverage will be 
"broken" instead of "overcast".  
Use the spread operator to reassign the sunday variable to an object containing all of the properties 
and values currently on sunday but with a cloudCoverage property set to "broken"

The new sunday object should look like this: 
{day: "Sunday", temperature: 17, cloudCoverage: "broken", wind: 30}
